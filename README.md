# Hypothesis Test Outcomes
This was an interactive widget I made with R, RStudio, and the RShiny package. The purpose was to facilitate the explanation of the potential outcomes of a hypothesis test. Typically, in a textbook, a diagram is shown, but it is static and doesn't adequately convey the intuition. This widget enables understanding of the intuition underlying a hypothesis test and the probabilities for potential errors (Type I & Type II Errors, Power, etc.) It really helped me to explain the concepts to my statistics students. It was my very first project. 

**FUNCTIONALITY**

The user can:
- Adjust the Effect size
- Adjust the size of Alpha
- Set the diagram for Two-tailed, Left-tailed or Right-tailed
- Toggle between which distribution is visually seen as being in the forefront
- Adjust the size of the standard error producing either a taller narrower distribution or a shorter fatter one
